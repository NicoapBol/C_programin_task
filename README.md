# C_programin_task
Hi Nicolas, I hope you're well. Please find attached the instructions in the word document outlining the two tasks that I wish for you to complete. The two tasks are related to each other. Please can you implement these tasks and give me version history of this as you build up the program i.e. different save points throughout creating each of the tasks. After this can you please create a document that explains in each task which programming paradigms you have used e.g. conditions, loops, file I/O, dynamic memory allocation etc. please can you let me know if this is feasible for you, and if so how much you would quote from this. If you take this one, try to complete this project within the next 24 hours as this would be greatly appreciated. I would need it completed by the 19th January at the latest. If this is possible then I have an additional project (after this) that is similar to this that I would like you to implement. Thank you for your help
